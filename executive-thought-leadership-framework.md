# Executive thought leadership framework

A repeatable system for turning your expertise into scalable influence.  
Built for operators. Not influencers.

---

## 1. Message-market fit

**Goal:** Align your unique POV with market needs.

- Identify a core theme rooted in real experience  
- Interview internal SMEs and customers to find blind spots  
- Use AI to summarize and cluster input (transcripts, notes, docs)  
- Avoid trends you can't speak to with firsthand insight

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: 1-page message map (theme, audience, key takeaways)

---

## 2. Treat content like a product

**Goal:** Build a scalable, sprint-based content system.

- Create a content backlog (Notion, Airtable, etc.)  
- Use 2â€“4 week sprints to ship high-quality assets  
- Assign roles: you = product owner, team = delivery  
- Use AI to assist with outlines, summaries, and backlog tagging

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Prioritized backlog, sprint calendar, content squad

---

## 3. Prioritize credibility over volume

**Goal:** Publish fewer, better pieces with strategic weight.

- Focus on frameworks, teardown blogs, white papers  
- Use AI to benchmark industry language and simplify drafts  
- Avoid fluff, listicles, and SEO-first content

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Quarterly anchor assets + 1â€“2 supporting pieces/month

---

## 4. Ghostwrite with constraints

**Goal:** Scale your voice without losing control.

- Record short interviews or async Looms  
- Use AI for transcription, summarization, and structural support  
- Final drafts are reviewed and approved by you  
- Maintain a voice guide with tone, banned words, and style cues

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Authentic, voice-aligned content at scale

---

## 5. Build anchor assets

**Goal:** Create content you can reuse 10+ times.

- Choose topics with strategic depth and long shelf life  
- Use AI to modularize into posts, decks, internal tools  
- Avoid one-and-done blogs or reactive hot takes

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: 2â€“3 flagship pieces/year, repurposed across teams

---

## 6. Start internal, then go external

**Goal:** Pressure-test your message before going public.

- Share anchor content via internal memos, AMAs, field notes  
- Use AI to personalize by role or team  
- Collect feedback to refine external messaging

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Internal buy-in + consistent external amplification

---

## 7. Use LinkedIn with intent

**Goal:** Extend your messageâ€”not feed the algorithm.

- Post 2â€“4x per month, tied to anchor assets  
- Use AI to reframe long-form ideas into single-point posts  
- No hashtags, no engagement bait, no inspirational filler

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Measured presence, not performance theater

---

## 8. Build reputation, not a personal brand

**Goal:** Be trusted, not famous.

- Focus on content your team, partners, and peers can use  
- Use AI to enforce tone and accelerateâ€”not originate  
- Track reuse, not likes (e.g. in RFPs, briefings, or sales decks)

> ðŸŽ¯ Output: Content that outlasts job titles and reorgs

---
